geospatial shapefile python scripts


1. Overview

This is a script file that leverages the shapefile.py library found at https://github.com/GeospatialPython/pyshp to perform a 
very, very rough buffer, create a new file, and find points within a buffer zone.

Most of the code like the point in poly function was taken from  http://geospatialpython.com/
